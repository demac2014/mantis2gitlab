# YouTrack2GitLab
Import YouTrack issues into GitLab.

## Install

```
npm install -g youtrack2gitlab
```

## Usage

```
yt2gl -i <input> -u <users> -g <gitlaburl> -p <project> -t <token>
```

## Options

```
-i, --input
 CSV file exported from YouTrack (Example: issues.csv)

-u, --users
 User mapping file (Example: users.json)

-g, --gitlaburl
 GitLab URL hostname (Example: gitlab.example.com)

-p, --project
 GitLab project name including namespace (Example: mycorp/myproj)

-t, --token
 An admin user's private token (Example: a2r33oczFyQzq53t23Vj)
```

## User Mapping File
In order to correctly map users you should create a JSON file with the following format and specify it with the **-u** switch:

```
[
  {
    "yt_username": "USER'S USERNAME IN YOUTRACK",
    "yt_name": "USER'S NAME IN YOUTRACK",
    "gl_username": "USER'S USERNAME IN GITLAB",
    "gl_private_token": "USER'S PRIVATE TOKEN IN GITLAB"
  },
  â€¦
]
```

## Notes
- Make sure the input CSV file only includes issues for the project you want to import.
- Make sure that all users have write access to the specified repository or some issues will fail to import. A safer approach is to set repository's **Visibility Level** to **Public** and revert it when the import process is complete.
- In version 6.4.3, GitLab API does not support setting creation date of issues. So all imported issues will have a creation time of now.
- In version 6.4.3, GitLab API fails to import issues with very long titles.
- In version 6.4.3, GitLab does not allow issues to be deleted. So be careful when importing issues into an active project.
- Milestones are not currently supported.
